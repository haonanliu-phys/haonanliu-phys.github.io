I am a theoretical physicist working on quantum optics and quantum computing. I received my PhD degree from University of Colorado Boulder after working at the JILA institute for six years. My major interest during PhD was to realize the first superradiant laser in the world. Superradiant lasers, contrary to traditional lasers, are much more robust against environmental noise and have the potential to set the new frequency standard. Rather than using ultracold atoms, we developed a scheme fed by a hot atomic beam and theoretically proved its feasibility. Ongoging experimental works can be found [here](https://www.iqclock.eu/publications.html).


Currently I work as a research fellow at the Centre for Quantum Technologies in the National University of Singapore. Here we started a small theoretical group under the [Nicholson Lab](https://nicholsonlabs.org). Our most recent interests include atomic clocks, quantum sensing, and non-Markovian quantum optics.


In my spare time, I like gymnastics, snowboarding and skiing. Both my wife and I are active PSIA-AASI members. Another gift from the lovely Rocky Mountains other than physics.
